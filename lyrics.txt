Rolling on a sweepstakes sixty-five;|Loaded with the cheapskates barely alive.

Rolling out the Jimmy, you can see the cracks;|Taps me on the shoulder, had a heart attack.

And when you push me, yeah you push me, yeah you push me too far;|I sit and then I cry upon the strings of my guitar.

And everybody tells me that it’s “shalalalala”|Oh yeah!

Stop me on the avenue, cuffs on my wrists;|Told me I was driving like a Ballroom Blitz;

Every time you leave me it comes to this;|Mix another medicine, mad scientist.

I said yeah, I’m so high and strung.

Why does it always have to come to this?|Late night, all night, miss your kiss.

Tripping on the sidewalk;|Living like a cyclone.

Was I in your heart?|Guess I never know where you go.

Harsh words in the headlamps;|Time to leave.

Dressing like a psycho;|Walking on the tightrope;|Funky like a monkey with my make-up running.

Too proud to find no time to breathe.

My baby's always threatening to leave;|You can do that or be here;|Almost brought me down to my knees.

You said I've never been clear.

Honey, you better believe now that there's nothing to fear, you can just leave.

Talking like I'm tanked up;|Reading from the black blook.

Everyone you know is a holy ghost sinner;|You look away as they crucify me.

Sleeping in the wreckage;|Loaded like a weapon.

I prophesise you'll miss the highs with me.

Would you say my prayers if I came here ill-prepared?

You can paint it all black 'cause you're never gonna get it clean.

Open the centerfold and behold;|The creases you've come to know make up your soul.

Inspect the spectacle, the divine show;|No one understands, but pretends to know.

Inside your little palm, singing psalms;|Peering through the spaces between your arms.

My story lacks in the facts I don't know what I'm on.

Coup de Grace;|Coup de Grace;|Coup de, coup de!

Running the circles through, right back to you;|Finding at the finish line, nothing new.

The let-down that sticks like glue;|Slipping through my fingers gripping onto what is left of you.

Waiting for lessons learned, taking turns;|The loudest of them all left to be unheard.

My story lacks in the facts that it's so absurd.

You know I want it;|You know I need it;|You know I need it all the time!

Life's never easy;|It keeps you guessing as you go.

Don't be looking at the scenery;|You should be heading up the road.

Hey brother, can you sell me some?|I think I'm brewing up a storm.

I was smiling at the radio;|They think I'm heading for a fall.

And now she's taking over;|I think she's taking over me.

And if she's taking over;|She's really got a hold on me.

Tears will flow;|But we'll never know until we try.

We have travelled the roads;|Gone from kisses to blows;|Only heaven knows where this story goes.

Leafing through the pages, my life's an open book.

What to do and where to go;|I need to take another look.

To be unfashionably outrageous;|A new insanity for my neighbour.

The finest clothes that you can find;|Dressed in my coat, I'm feeling fine.

I'll shine so hard, I'll stand up high;|These foolish ways, I know my place.

My time is now, my time is now.

Although we're tongue-tied and breathless, we won't let our worries dictate who we are.

Don't forget who you are.

Don't build me up, make up your mind.

Then keep the faith, I'll keep the faith.

I like your style, you make me smile.

Throw out the old doubts;|We won't let our worries dictate who we are.

When Mister Brown said he felt good, I tell you it's no lie;|I feel better than that.

When Johnny and the Silver Beatles had your volume high;|I feel better than that.

Maybe it's the time and place, or maybe it's your stupid face that's turning me on.

Maybe it's the crowded room, or maybe it's the bass drum boom that is kicking this song.

The first time that you saw Bardot inside you really glow;|But I feel better than that.

You had a crush on Brandon and you tingle down below;|But I feel better than that.

Maybe it's the strobing lights, or maybe it's the music that is turning me on.

Maybe it's your go-go hair, or maybe it's the cracking snare that's hitting this song.

One four letter word is the sole reason why;|Let me spell it out for you;|L-O-V-E.

Take a locomotive with it's head all full of steam;|I feel better than that.

Like a Saturn C5 rocket with a rollercoaster scream;|I feel better than that.

If I dream about the end of our story;|We'll see our names carved into stone.

You're taking me on a journey into the unknown.

Listening to the thoughts slowly break in;|The sirens singing songs in my head.

When I feel her touch I believe love;|Love is not a drug that's for certain.

But we'll rock as we roll, rev the engines and go;|Let's get out of control.

When I'm falling apart, and I'm lost in a world on my own;|I know that there's a place in your heart that I can call home.

And I'm dreaming of you, girl, in this story;|And it feels just like it did at the start.

There'll never be an end to our journey unless we're apart.

This world keeps on rotating and it's always changing who we are.

I can see that the past is fading, but the future is waiting here to start.

And then it hit me, and it blew my mind;|Like a bombshell everytime.

Seize the moments and see the signs;|This world is yours;|Yours and mine.

If your world gets tilted sideways and you've lost your highway home;|Through the clouds, all the stars are shining and the silver lining glows.

I need excitement, I need a cure when I feel so insecure.

All the treasures in life's store;|That's where we are heading for.

I take my moment, and you take yours;|I love this feeling, and I want more.

You're guilty, it's proven;|It's written all over your face.

My instincts are burning;|Are gauging up beyond the pace.

I'm bloodshot, I'm ready to come and give you what I owe.

Tonight, I want to forget forever;|Tonight, so let's come together.

Embellished in the story, it's growing bigger by the hour;|It's a tough one, it's a rough one.

The excitement of the chase;|I'll meet you on the corner in the cold midnight hour.

So stand up, line up;|Stand up for your shot in the dark.

I've noticed things changing;|Is it too late for us now, baby?

Is it too late?|It's never too late.

What condition am I in when you're racing round my head?

What condition am I in when I'm burning in my bed?

It's a mystery, I can't get started;|She's leaving broken-hearted.

Like the ripples in last night's drinking;|I'm starting to over think it now.

Visualising things could be better than they are;|I'm spending as I'm swinging from a star.

Spiral out of control on my way back home;|Now the night is done and the day is to come.

Near enough to the truth, I believe it's living proof;|What's left to say about the games people play?

What else can a poor boy do, to live his whole life reckless and blue?

And illusions in the dark only add more fire in my heart.

There's a light in the sky;|There's a sign that waves goodbye.

After all that we've been through, I can't help myself from loving you.

You're gonna get it;|You're gonna get it now.

I'm gonna show you;|I'm gonna show you how.

I'm gonna raise it;|I'm gonna raise your game.

You're gonna see that we're not the same.

Chasing tail like you're on a trail;|What's the point in knowing nothing at all?

Wasting time trying to find your bride;|Burning my last fuse, so I'll give you a clue.

Night enraged, locked in a cage;|Well, I'm breaking out, I'm gonna scream and shout.

Choosing sides and I wanna win;|Don't say your vows on my parade.

People call me superstitious;|Well, they better watch their tongue.

This one is so malicious;|Got me on the hit and run.

Mirrors and suicide;|It's got me terrified.

Shock horror deep inside;|Intuition never lies.

You always get what you want;|Just by strutting your stuff.

Give up;|Come on, and give up control!

You stand so tall, you come and take it all.

Saw you in a magazine;|Now I read your double spread.

What does the future hold?|Well, you better keep your head.

People talking through my mind;|Strike it down, losing time.

Under pressure so unwind;|Catch you some other time.

You're pretty good-looking, but I'm looking for a way out.

Wanna make it clear, and really say it all;|Well, it just keeps swirling 'round inside our crystal ball.

Trick or treat then vanish with my stolen goods;|I find myself all lost inside my neighbourhood.

There's a darkness in our hearts;|And my smile hides an aching heart.

Although we're close, we're miles apart;|Don't let this darkness fill our hearts.

Hey, I'm not like everybody else;|You're not like everybody else;|Face the facts.

Mirror thoughts keep bouncing up and down my spine;|Well, I hypnotise myself that everything is fine.

Expressing what I'm feeling though it hurts to say;|When the novelty wears off and we just drift away.

Blown my final fuse, that's the electric on you;|That keeps on burning, keeps on tripping out.

The longer it goes, the harder I know a change is coming.

The whole time I've been gone, I thought you were alone;|You were caught in the act, you were playing away from home.

Breaking in, no way out;|Well, I'm looking for a loophole, but it feels like I'm spinning out.

Got home early from work to find you doing worse;|But why did you do it?|Why did you push me too far?

Uncharted territory escaping me;|It's bowled me over, it's cold and plain to see.

The way I found out, your laziness let you down;|You were spreading yourself about the town.

The worst that you could do after all you put me through;|Is it worth cracking up over you?

I'm gonna get right;|I'm gonna find my feet again.

I'm gonna squeeze tight, no way I'm turning back;|I'm gonna burn bright and forget about all of that.

There's nowhere to hide, girl;|I'll bring ya' back to life.

Mr. Midnight;|I feel it deep inside;|Baby, just to clarify, I'm gonna get right.

I'm gonna turn it all around, you're gonna jack knife;|I wanna hear the way you sound.

You had me on my knees;|Just for a minute, nearly lost my mind.

Don't you come crawling back to me;|I've hit my limit, girl, don't waste my time.

You can try and be discreet, and you can hide in the backseat all you like;|Sit tight while I get right.

I’ve been up in all my dreams, screaming out in ecstasy;|And down to reality, there's something coming over me.

What you see is what you get with fingers on the cigarette;|You got a face I can’t forget, but I’ve smoked my memory.

I’m delving into another world that I found.

Come on and crank it up;|I want it louder, I want the winner’s luck.

I see my future inside that woman’s touch.

We were talking way too loud, but where we go we hit the ground?|Nowhere else will be allowed, you won’t need to know the time.

Evidently into you, I am gonna wait for you;|But before the night is over, I’m gonna try and blow your mind.

I know that I’m moving, I can feel it fall;|I know what I’m doing, I don’t wanna score.

True romance is what I'm after, darling.

Crawling through like midnight panthers growling at the moon.

I'm on higher ground;|You're the last of your kind.

Sub-zero, I know you're as cold as ice;|Gives me frostbite, it seems I just can't get enough.

Those exploding roads;|Tinted spectacles in the back of my mind.

Chinese whispers floating 'round;|Heaven knows I'm the first of my kind.

I begin, I come out, of the trance;|Take it in, took it out, took a chance.

Strolling up, strolling on, hang it up;|But I'm not chewing on your gums.

Suck it up, spit it out, move it on;|Sing it loud, sing it sad, sing along.

Start it up, start it now, start again;|But I'm not picking up your gun.

What do I have to do to get you where I want you?

You're a million miles, a million miles away;|So come closer.

Your reasons don't make any sense, I'll never rely on you;|And you're draped on him while you're staring at me.

I wanna make your smoke and kisses black and white;|Measure all your spinning whispers in the loose moonlight.

Magic from your fingers tingles down my spine;|Colour in between the lines.

You rearrange my mind.

An uneasy feeling churns inside of me;|I'll draw it on a wall for you all to see.

Tryin' to find a diamond in an avalanche;|But you just haven't had the chance.

When I turn to my favourite hideaway, my hand on hip will always be the same;|Only half the plan.

Once I thought that I was over you, now you're back and I'm falling like a fool, you know, the one I am.

I'm ridiculed by my fantasy, scheduling insanity;|My eagerness comes untangled, I can't handle you.

At least it will be a thrill keeping up with you.

I'm going 'round and 'round this bunch of keys, so let me in, 'cause I'm about to freeze with my jealousy.

Trying hard to persuade myself that you aren't everything I need, but my tricks are weak.

Oh, darling, hold me like before.

I'm counting down the days;|Love seems strange to me.

Excuse me, you're killing me with your heartbreak and your wild signs.

I've been looking for something to open my eyes;|Holding it up to the light only locks it away.

Out of focus, joking with the ups and downs;|Hocus pocus, nowhere to be found.

I wanna climb on your shadow;|I wanna use pseudonyms.

You see the way and I'll follow;|I won't try to escape.

And I don't know why on Earth;|I'm calling, calling at this time of night.

You've got me hoping for some happenstance, baby;|You've got me uptight.

I don't know who you are;|All I know is you fold me in half.

I want the slope of your sorrow;|I want the curve of your neck.

I want the fuse to your morals;|Well, I want the keys to your chest.

Darling, all I know is I'm caught up on you.

Riding on this wave of blue sequins;|You're shimmering.

Tango, foxtrot, I'm in trouble.

I see you falling, gently onto the cobbles;|Skipping into the quicksand, not into my arms.

I see I'm falling, gently onto the cobbles;|Skipping into the quicksand, not into your arms.

Delicate and gently does it;|Won't you dedicate your hate to another?

Well, I've been looking forward to lifting up the veil;|Yes is the answer, you know that for sure.

The nighttime is the right time;|Oh, don't you know, girl?|You've heard it before.

Cold is the shoulder you'll give me for sure;|Dance with your hips and grind on the floor.

The kingcrawler of mercy will sit you in his perch;|Death lurks 'round the corner where the clowns begin to smirk.

Glued to the blood are the stains, the scars that trickle your pretty face;|Rescue the hands that fiddle the bet, and roll the dice to forget.

The kingcrawler;|He'll take you down, down, down.

Gazing at the stars that light up the sky when he sees the fear in your eyes;|Give up the escape route, you're here to stay.

I've been searching for love, I'm sorry I escaped you;|I wonder how I will end.

For now, I'll carry to push on through and bite my jealous lip, and hope to turn it to a kiss.

Take this night from me, girl;|You're stunningly divine.

You're the love I've been searching for.

'Cause I will be true and be faithful, and that's not like me.

And now, my worried concave of thoughts won't linger anymore, because I've been trying my best.

Yet still, I've been skipping through my years to cover my sacred tears;|Ready for the heartaches and fears.

Take it from me, and then, darling, you'll ask me where I've been.

I can feel you searching 'round my brain, looking for a way to make a wave.

Floating out and in, and in and out again;|'Til our falling thoughts cascade together.

Telepathy to the rescue;|Just look at me and I will let you know.

I can see you making little flames, all along the path to guide the way.

Sipping on your looks, but you drink me in;|Pass over the flattery again.

I lock them up with all the rest;|It's haggard, heavy on my chest.

Confessions are bouncing 'round my head, so I add them to the archive of things we've never said;|I lock them up with all the rest.

Though it's tempting to confess, it's better left invisible for now.

If you'd just get it together and read my mind, then sleeping would be easy;|Then I'll be there to acquiesce, I confess I'm in trouble.

Another afternoon of increments and asking the wrong questions;|And then you get up and leave again, just as the evening threatens to set.

Consider this now, it's not too late;|I have watched you change the colour of the trap before, girl;|I have learned to wait.

Most of the things that you say I don't understand, but I will sit and listen;|And nod along attentively, but the truth is I can't concentrate.

I have learned to wait, and you have learned that you can make me.

I need something to sort me out;|I need someone to come and shake me.

And your exit calms me down before it infuriates me;|Girl, I'm in trouble.

Wish you'd just get it together and read my mind.

Listen up and settle down, stop wondering what is right and what is wrong.

Staring out into an old street, praying that this night won't ever end;|Accompanied by a stranger, lost in the excitement of it all.

I don't wanna see the morning come.

In a pool with the sharks, I fall from the start.

A lion calling in the morning.

A sinner should sway, you're backing away now.

Your knight must go to war.

I'll just gather myself from this lovers' fall;|This planted suspicion that I've endured.

Everybody's talking, but I don't understand.

Are you feeling what I'm feeling?;|'Cause it means nothing to the ghost that we've become.

I can't keep my distance from you;|Don't know what else to do.

You know the shape of the shadows I want to make, not before it's midnight.

Spells and falling under;|Can't take it much longer.

You've got the face for the path I want to take.

Can't you see what you mean to me?
